## Welcome to the Script Side Wiki

This wiki is provided to allow users to follow along as FueledByOCHD from AMT LLC works to provide a custom rebuild of the Pokemon Essentials which provides the same basic functionality although the direct implimentation will be provided through a C# style hybrid of the Ruby Language and build with editing and modding in mind and also providing a cleaner workspace by moving any commonly called functionality to abstract it out. Making alot of the systems cleaner while providing enhanced versions of the default systems along with custom functionality spesifict to PokeCult and to make the world feel more alive along the way.
